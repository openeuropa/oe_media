@api
Feature: Remote video media entities.
  In order to show remote videos on the website
  As a site editor
  I want to be able to reference remote videos.

  @cleanup:node @cleanup:media
  Scenario Outline: Remote videos can be referenced and attached to nodes.
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "create oe_media_demo content, create remote_video media" permissions
    When I go to "the remote video selection page"
    Then I should see the heading "Add Remote video"
    When I fill in "Remote video URL" with "<url>"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the heading "<title>"

    When I go to "the demo content creation page"
    Then I should see the heading "Create OpenEuropa Media Demo"
    When I fill in "Title" with "My Node"
    And I fill in the "remote video" reference field with "<title>"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the heading "My Node"
    And I should see the embedded video player for "<url>"
    And I should see the oEmbed video iframe "<url>" with cookie consent kit usage

    Examples:
      | url                                         | title                            |
